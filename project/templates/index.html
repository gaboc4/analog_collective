          <p>Founded by a musician and producer, Analog Collective grew out of a need for a trustworthy tool that
            artists can use to grow their audience on Spotify. If you’re here, you’ve probably already spent money
            on music promotion with little to show for it. </p>
          <p>With Analog Collective, you’ll have the unique ability to search our database for playlists
            that have followers from your target demographic. Our self-service platform allows YOU to do decide where
            you hope to have your music placed, and which artists you’d like to see yourself curated beside.</p>
